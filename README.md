AngularJS is a structural client side framework to create dynamic web applications. It let us use HTML as template and extend HTML syntax to express application components. AngularJS supports data binding and dependency injection within the browser. It also allows us to apply standard, best software engineering practices in the client side to accelerate front end development. All this is done in JavaScript and HTML so we do not need to lear new programming language.

 It supports MVC (Model View Controller) style of application design.

                Model – contains the data that represents the current state of the application.

                Views – it displays the data

                Controller – it manages the relationship between the model and the view.
